"""Resilient HTTP for the hand-rolled REST helpers (Cloud rate-limits with 429s).

The batch ingestion path has always retried; everything *else* (verify's query-back,
the prompt-label PATCH, the project guardrail, score-config creation) did a single shot
and ``raise_for_status``'d. Against Langfuse Cloud those single shots get 429ed — the v2
query API in particular throttles the rapid paginated reads ``synth verify`` fires, and
the reserved-pool check hits one ``/traces/{id}`` per trace back-to-back. This adds one
retry helper, **Retry-After-aware**, shared by all of them. See :mod:`synth.target` for
where the Cloud-only ``throttle_s`` spacing comes from.
